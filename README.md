# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

It is now deployed to Heroku and viewable here:

FriendFinder uses the following technologies

- Node.js
- Bootstrap CSS framework

### Notes on this project

This project was one of the most difficult so far. Using server API to navigate pages, as well as deliver and edit data was more complex than I originally expected.

I also used sliders as an input for the first time, and that was a unique experience getting the labels to change as the slider moved. It also made validation easier, because not only would the slider start at a neutral value, but the selection, with the confirmation of the label text feels a lot more intuitive.

## Future of the project:

My intentions, given more time, is to clean up the "best friend return modal" to make the page look even more cleaner. and add better navigation, and footers linking to my portfolio for future and further navigation.
